# Intro

I am a software engineer with a focus on infrastructure and blockchain and a love for cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes and Helm. I did my B.Sc. at the University of British Columbia specializing in Honours Computer Science and Physics. I love the outdoors and nature, and spend my free time surrounded by it. That is when I am not looking at a screen.

# Currently

I currently work for the team behind Synapse Protocol in Newport Beach, CA. We are a 10-person startup that builds and maintains blockchain infrastructure for one of the largest crypto bridges with over $43B in volume. We support 20 EVM and non-EVM chains. My expertise is in building infrastructure using Kubernetes for large workloads like blockchains and ERP.

# Some history

- Growing up in Bulgaria I always enjoyed studying English and wanted to move to an English speaking country.
- In grade 8 I was terrified to take my first Physics class, but 10 minutes into the class I realized I absolutely loved it.
- When applying for universities I ended up getting rejected for Physics and only accepted for CS degrees (which were my backup choices). I had to accept an offer for CS and transfer to Physics later on. However CS was quite enjoyable so I did both and now work entirely in the CS industry.
- I didn't expect to spend 5 years at SAP, but I have constantly found new opportunities and challenges and enjoyed my work.
- Moving to Coinbase was a calculated risk during a down market for Crypto, but so far it has panned out.
- After joining Synapse I was the only DevOps engineer and got to setup our blockchain infrastructure the way I saw fit and learned a lot doing it.
