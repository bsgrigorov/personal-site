# Intro

I am a software engineer with a focus on infrastructure and a love for cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes and Helm. I did my Bachelor's of Science at the University of British Columbia specializing in Honours Computer Science and Physics. I love the outdoors and nature, and spend my free time surrounded by it. That is when I am not looking at a screen.

# Currently

I currently work for SAP LLC in Newport Beach, CA. We are building next generation cloud-native solutions that complement SAP's existing ERP solutions and solve real pain points that our customers have. I am heavily focused on maintaining, automating and monitoring our infrastructure on Kubernetes clusters we have depoyed in a multi-cloud environment. We utilize the newest technologies and try to use open-source when possible. I use Prometheus, Loki, Helm, Harbor, GitOps and other technologies on a daily basis.

# Some history

- Growing up in Bulgaria I always enjoyed studying English and wanted to move to an English speaking country.
- In grade 8 I was terrified to take my first Physics class, but 10 minutes into the class I realized I absolutely loved it.
- When applying for universities I ended up getting rejected for Physics and only accepted for CS degrees (which were my backup choices). I had to accept an offer for CS and transfer to Physics later on. However CS was quite enjoyable so I did both and now work entirely in the CS industry.
- I didn't expect to spend 5 years at SAP, but I have constantly found new opportunities and challenges and continue to enjoy working here.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
