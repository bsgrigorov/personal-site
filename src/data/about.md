# Intro

I am a software engineer with a focus on infrastructure and blockchain and a love for cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes and Helm. I did my B.Sc. at the University of British Columbia specializing in Honours Computer Science and Physics. I love the outdoors and nature, and spend my free time surrounded by it. That is when I am not looking at a screen.

# Currently

I currently work for Coinbase in Newport Beach, CA. We are supporting Web3 by building world class blockchain infrastructure in Kubernetes. As part of the Coinbase Cloud team, I am developing, upgrading and monitoring blockchain nodes and validators for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Zcash, Cosmos, Avalanche, Helium and Flow. My expertise is in building infrastructure using Kubernetes for large workloads like blockchains and ERP.

# Some history

- Growing up in Bulgaria I always enjoyed studying English and wanted to move to an English speaking country.
- In grade 8 I was terrified to take my first Physics class, but 10 minutes into the class I realized I absolutely loved it.
- When applying for universities I ended up getting rejected for Physics and only accepted for CS degrees (which were my backup choices). I had to accept an offer for CS and transfer to Physics later on. However CS was quite enjoyable so I did both and now work entirely in the CS industry.
- I didn't expect to spend 5 years at SAP, but I have constantly found new opportunities and challenges and enjoyed my work.
- Moving to Coinbase was a calculated risk during a down market for Crypto, so let's hope it pans out.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
