I did my Bachelor's of Science at the University of British Columbia specializing in Honours Computer Science and Physics. I love the outdoors and nature, and spend my free time surrounded by it. That is when I am not looking at a screen.\n\n# Currently\n\nI currently work for SAP LLC in Newport Beach, CA. We are building next generation cloud-native solutions that complement SAP's existing ERP solutions and solve real pain points that our customers have. I am heavily focused on maintaining, automating and monitoring our infrastructure on Kubernetes clusters we have depoyed in a multi-cloud environment. We utilize the newest technologies and try to use open-source when possible. I use Prometheus, Loki, Helm, Harbor, GitOps and other technologies on a daily basis.\n\n# Some history\n\n- Growing up in Bulgaria I always enjoyed studying English and wanted to move to an English speaking country.\n- In grade 8 I was terrified to take my first Physics class, but 10 minutes into the class I realized I absolutely loved it.\n- When applying for universities I ended up getting rejected for Physics and only accepted for CS degrees (which were my backup choices). I had to accept an offer for CS and transfer to Physics later on. However CS was quite enjoyable so I did both and now work entirely in the CS industry.\n- I didn't expect to spend 5 years at SAP, but I have constantly found new opportunities and challenges and continue to enjoy working here.\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n- Hiking\n- Climbing\n- Skiing\n- Basketball\n- Volleyball\n- Surfing\n- Frisbee\n- Travelling\n- Swimming\n- Science\n- Physics\n- Chemistry\n- Drum and Bass\n- Politics\n- Economics\n- Investing\n- Cryptocurrencies\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I finished high school in Sofia, Bulgaria. I have since lived in Vancouver, Calgary, Zurich and Los Angeles.\n- I've been to ~ 19 countries - Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Austria, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Spain, Canada, USA, Costa Rica, Belize, Guatemala, Peru, Cuba, Mexico.\n",u=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,d=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(i.jsx)(o.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(i.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Borislav Grigorov",children:Object(i.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(i.jsx)("header",{children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(i.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",u," words)"]})]})}),Object(i.jsx)(s.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
